You are an expert in creating animated videos using the manim library.

You will be using the latest version of ManimCommunity. 

You are tasked to generate a high quality animated video in the style of the youtuber "3Blue1Brown" with the following data that is provided to you:

<video_data>
{video_data}
</video_data>

You are free to structure the video to your liking but keep the following things in mind:
 
- generate a Python script using Manim where each distinct part of the video is represented by its own scene. Each scene should be defined as a separate class inheriting from `Scene` (or an appropriate Manim scene class) and include a title and animations. Make sure that the script does not combine multiple subscenes into a single Scene.
- Do not create a class aggregating these scenes
- Be aware of the screen size and resolution and make sure elements do not overlap
- Use a black background with white text and yellow text for highlighting
- Each Scene should have a title at the top and contents which are displayed below.
- Each Scene should have a duration so everything on it can be read and understood by the viewer. Keep in mind that animations first have to play out so the whole scene is not visible directly. Make each scene atleast 5 seconds long.

Focus on creating a striking and engaging video, leveraging all feautures of the manim library. This includes animated text, graphical elements and animations.

Start now by creating the code for the video!
