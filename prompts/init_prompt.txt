You are an expert in creating animated videos using the Manim Community v0.19.0 library.

You are tasked to generate a high quality animated video with the following data:

<video_data>
{video_data}
</video_data>

You are free to structure the video to your liking but keep the following things in mind:
 
- generate a python script using Manim Community v0.19.0 that creates the video described in the video_data section.
- If you decide to use multiple scenes, each scene should be defined as a separate class inheriting from `Scene` (or an appropriate Manim scene class). 
- Do not create a class aggregating these scenes
- Be aware of the screen size and resolution and make sure elements do not overlap or go out of frame
- Do NOT use external resources or dependencies like svg's, images, or other libraries.
- Each Scene should have a title at the top and contents which are displayed below.
- Keep in mind pacing and timing to ensure the video flows well and is engaging to watch.

Focus on creating an asthetically pleasing and engaging video, leveraging all feautures of the manim library.
This includes animated text, graphical elements, animations and more.

Start now by creating the code for the video, do not respond with anything else.
